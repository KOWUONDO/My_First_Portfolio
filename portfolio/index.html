      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        My journey in technology began with a deep curiosity about how digital systems work. I enrolled in a Diploma in ICT to build a solid foundation in computer systems, networking, and software development. Eager to go further, I joined the ALX-Holberton Software Engineering program, where I’ve been sharpening my skills in full-stack development, problem-solving, and real-world coding challenges. Each step has brought me closer to my goal of becoming a professional software engineer.
